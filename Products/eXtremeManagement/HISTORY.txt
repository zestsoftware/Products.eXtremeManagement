2.0.3 (2010-05-01)
------------------

- Poi portlet: show more of the title of possible stories for creating
  a PoiTask in.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/208
  [maurits]

- In the Project Links portlet, show a link to the first PoiTracker;
  fall back to an item with the id 'issues'.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/207
  [maurits]

- Show the simple tasklist in more cases, like when you view the
  global task_overview when you only have the Employee role locally on
  a Project.  Do show less detail then.
  Fixes http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/202
  [maurits]

- Give Employees the 'Copy or Move' permission also on closed Projects.
  Refs http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/186
  [maurits]

- Also show Iterations in the 'for own account' state in the finished
  iterations overview, and show a link to that in the iterations
  portlet.  Fixes #178
  [maurits]

- Fixed i18n inconsistencies.
  [maurits]

- Fixed hard-coded WF ID for iteration CTs.  This should fix #204.
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/204/view
  [seletz]

- Added edit link+icon on manage_simple_tasklist table to have an
  short link to to the edit form of the task. [jensens]

- Title of story in offer_view is now a link to the story's view. [jensens] 

- Started german translation. Refinement follows. [jensens] 

- Fixed issue of disappearing iterations in the planned, finished, invoiced
  and inprogress iteration view. Sorting on fields that have no value will
  remove those items from the result. Alse the code has been refactored by
  adding memoizes and moving portal_state to xmbase. [jladage]


2.0.2 (2009-05-05)
------------------

- Added position:relative on #schedule-field to fix the overflow in IE7.
  [laurens]

- Removed schedule-bumber tag and css: it messed up IE7/IE8. [laurens]

- css and additional html for iteration-slider. [laurens]

- Fix several problems with automatically closing iterations:

  - First check for duplicate story IDs in the new iteration.

  - Remove bookings from new iteration instead of the current.

  - Changed the permission for the close-iteration view to
    AddIteration instead of Manage Portal.

  [fred + mark]

- Reinstated the xm.story.detailsbox provider as the canonical spot
  for putting the story details box.  Previously it was there and in
  the story_view.pt, which meant there were subtle differences when
  creating a booking (provider was updated) and just viewing the page
  (the story_view.pt was used).  All has been moved to the provider.
  [maurits]

- Allow starting a Task when it has no assignees, so Employees can
  pick their Tasks.  We plan to create a view to make that picking
  easier, or perhaps to bulk assign some tasks.  [maurits]

- Refactor the tests so we can have doctests being unit tests. [mark]

- Removed all traces of the show_task_count option for the story list,
  as since the last commit it was always set to False.  [maurits+mike]

- In the project view, show the totals of the current iteration(s).
  In the simple story list, fix the colspan.  [maurits+mike]

- Do not give Customers (or Contributors) any permissions on
  bookings.  [maurits+mike]

- For a Customer that is smart enough to traverse to a Task manually,
  we only show the title and nothing more.  [maurits+mike]

- Protect the Add task form in the story view with the Add Task
  permission, so for example Customers are not shown this option.
  [maurits+mike]

- Do not show Customers the total estimated hours of all tasks in a
  story.  [maurits+mike]

- Do not show the task details in the expanded story view for
  Customers.  [maurits+mike]

- Rename 'Can track projects' to include 'customer' so that it is obvious
  that this is the role to assign to customers who should have access to XM.
  Updated several translations and added the translation labels for the
  XM specific roles [laurens+fred]

- Added permission xm.ViewDetails (eXtremeManagement: View Details).
  In the rolemap.xml we give this permission to Manager,
  Projectmanager and Employee.  The task list in the story view is now
  protected with this permission.  [maurits+mike]

- Added dependency on collective.autopermission.  [maurits+mike]

- Do not give Contributors the Modify portal content permission in the
  booking workflow.  Customers that for some reason also have the
  Contributor role could edit bookings.  Note: needs an update of the
  security settings in the portal_workflow.  [maurits+mike]

- Fixed iteration closing tests by using properties.
  Fixed 'TypeError: unindexable object' in iteration closing view.
  [maurits]


2.0.1 (2009-03-22)
------------------

- Fixed http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/168
  In the planned iterations view you can now add new iterations [jladage]

- Fixed http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/166 [jladage]

- When viewing a task in a completed story would show you a login form. This
  was caused by removing the modify portal content permission for manager
  [jladage]

- Fixed http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/167 [jladage]

- Updated README.txt with the time tracker and iteration closing feature. [jladage]

- Added setup.py with aliases to upload to pypi and plone.org [jladage]


2.0 (2009-03-15)
----------------

- Project managers can now close an iteration and automate copying over unfinished
  stories, including unfinished tasks. [jladage]

- Updated Projects and Story workflows.  [maurits+jladage]

- Fixed Typo in permission to guard editing the budget hours. [jladage]

- Fixed bug in pending stories portlet. [maurits+jladage]

- Added extra check in poi portlet to only show when there are open
  issues.  Fixes issue 154.  [maurits]

- Actually use the description textarea from the submitted add task
  form.  [maurits]


2.0rc2 (2009-01-26)
-------------------

- Only display transition warning icon when there are messages. [jladage]

- Only display project portlet is there are any links to show. [jladage]

2.0rc1 (2009-01-25)
-------------------

- Fixed workflow messages in task view and add i18n. [jladage]

- Added translations for the two templates in xm.booking [jladage]

- Fixed issue 100, list of projects are loaded on DOM load. [reinout +
  mark]

- Show images and files from the story in the offer view.  [maurits+fred]

- Fixed another part of issue 131: by committing subtransactions more
  often, less ConflictErrors occur and their impact is less. This
  should speed things up at least a bit. [reinout + mark]

- Moved the startStory and startIteration scripts zo they are
  triggered *before* the transition of the story/iteration. [reinout +
  mark]

- Gave our custom roles (Customer, Employee, Projectmanager) some of
  the permissions defined by CMFEditions.  Case in point: on the Zest
  projects site we started using versioning for Stories, and a
  non-Manager/Owner could no longer edit a Story... [maurits]

- Fixed issue 131 for changing the workflow state of a task in the
  story view. Other workflow changed still need attention; they may be
  the result of ConflictErrors. [reinout + mark]

- Fixed issue 112, when reactivating a task in a completed story, the story is
  set to ' in-progress'. [jladage]

- Fixed issue 111, customers can now only view issue of their own trackers.
  [jladage]

- Fixed issue 113, customers and employees can now add files and images to the
  story. [jladage]

  and updated translations. [jladage]

- Fixed issue 134, releaseplan now uses id attributes that start with story-*
  [jladage].

  planned and finished iterations if there is something to show. [jladage]

- Fixed issue 139, the dropdown with related tasks in the poi portlet has now
  a fixed width. [jladage]

- The listing of In-Progress iterations now has links for billable and
  unbillable iterations. [jladage]

- Added listing of iterations that have been invoiced this month. [jladage]

- In the releaseplan you can now drag and drop stories to/from the unplanned
  stories table. [jladage]


2.0beta3 (2009-01-11)
---------------------

- Fixed bug in the 'my projects' listing in the project portlet. [jladage]


2.0beta2 (2009-01-09)
---------------------

- Refactored the add_task KSS - it now collapses again. [simon]

- Added totals to the finished iterations view and (total) estimate to
  the planned iterations view. [reinout + mark]

- Removed My task listing from iteration view, to allow role based caching.
  [jladage]

- Commenting has been disabled. [jladage]

- Add task KSS is now also collapseable. [simon, fred]

- Use plone_tools where possible, getting rid of getToolByName.



2.0beta1 (2009-01-08)
---------------------

- Fixed translations

- The my project dropdown now displays all active projects for ProjectManagers.
  [jladage]

- Removed personalized My todo list from iteration view. [jladage]

- When no start or end date is provided, simply a dash is displayed. [jladage]

- The release plan was guarded with Manage Portal permission, this is now
  set to the View permission. [jladage]

- The 'add task' link is now only displayed when the user has the correct
  permission. [simon]

- Removed the Project Administration templates and view. [jladage]

- Removed the old update_hours_form, we now have the time tracker. [jladage]

- Corrected the available method for the tasks portlet, so anonymous
  doesn't see it. [jladage]

- Added site action 'Projects' to link to the project website, this way
  we are consistent with the time tracker site actions. [jladage]



2.0alpha3 (2009-01-07)
----------------------

- The Add task form at the story view is now loaded using kss. By default no
  assignee is selected.[jladage]

- Updated the dutch translations.[jladage]

- Added a link to a list of 'Planned iterations' to the iterations portlet.
  [jladage]

- Cleaned up a number of templates that are not used anymore,
  project_administration, customer_view, etc. [jladage]

- Current iteration link in the Iterations portlet now provides a correct URL.
  In addition if two iterations are in the state 'in-progress' a status message
  will guide you to the other iteration. [jladage]

- Added view that lists finished (=invoiced or completed) iterations.
  [reinout]

- Setuphandlers.py now zaps several known old-style portlets.  [reinout]

- Replaced story estimation portlet by a new-style one.  [reinout]

- Removed obsolete portlet_my_projects portlet.  [reinout]

- Added better documentation to portlets.xml, unified names/titles of portlets
  in various places. [reinout]

- Added new-style link-to-poi-issue portlet as replacement for part of the
  old-style poi portlet. [reinout]

- Added new-style poi_creation portlet as replacement for part of the
  old-style poi portlet. [reinout]

- Fixed possible DiscussionNotAllowed error when expanding a Story.
  [maurits]

- Now refreshing story details box provider when quick-adding a Task.
  [maurits]

- Changed story details box into a provider (viewlet manager without
  viewlets) so we can refresh that provider with KSS.  [maurits]

- Moved "eXtremeManagement: View Tracker" permission from xm.tracker
  to Products.eXtremeManagement as we do not actually use that
  permission in the xm.tracker package but only in actions.xml of
  Products.eXtremeManagement.  This also means we do not have to have
  a dependency on xm.tracker (at least currently). [maurits]

- Fixed issue #127 - "Add task" widget breaks if there aren't Employees
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/127
  [maurits]

- Renamed reorder_stories to releaseplan [jladage].

- The time tracker is now guarded by a special permission. As a result only
  users with the Projectmanager or Employee assigned globally will be able to
  use the timetracker. [jladage]

- The invoicing view now only shows projects that are billable. This change
  requires that the getBillableProject index has to be reindexed manually [jladage]

- Instead of sending an email to new assignees of a Task whenever that
  Task is edited, only send an email when the Task gets transitioned
  to the to-do state.  Also made the email sending more robust in the
  face of special characters, like Czech.  This refs:
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/92
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/118
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/124
  [maurits]

- Enable optional experimental.catalogqueryplan usage. This needed a fix in
  some of the tests as experimental.catalogqueryplan caches daterange results
  in REQUEST. Add the egg to buildout's egg list to get a speed increase.
  [reinout]

- Show the number of comments of a Story in the story details viewlet
  (when expanding the story in the iteration view).  Fixes
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/87
  [maurits]

- Employees overview: show the strict percentages and totals for the
  week, meaning: count only the days in this month.  The totals and
  percentages that really count the whole week are now available as a
  tooltip.  This is pending refactoring into two views as Managers and
  Employees have a different wish list here.  [maurits]

- Moved employees_overview page here from xm.theme.  [maurits]

- Fix: Only add the billable hours of a day to the week/month when
  some work (billable or not) has been done on that day.  [maurits]

- In the migration from ProjectFolders/CustomerFolders to normal
  Folders, set the immediately addable types too.  Note that Customer
  content type is not addable by default anymore, so in the migrated
  CustomerFolder you can only add a Customer when you allow Customers
  to be added globally.  [maurits]

- Refactored KSS, CSS, JS and Python for workflow gadgets. Removed duplicated
  ids (#task-list-for-story) in favour of existing class (.tasklist_table),
  added KSS rebinding of workflow menus and stripped redundant CSS. [simon]

- Added /inprogress view for managers that lists all in-progress iterations.
  [reinout]

- Added /invoicing view for managers that lists all invoicable
  iterations. [reinout]

- Removed almost all descriptions for Customer as they're useless ("enter
  address" description for an "address" field). Some of the descriptions were
  wrong anyway. Fixes
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/71 [reinout]

- Added checks whether start/endDate are set as toLocalizedTime(None) returns
  today as value. So unset start/end dates looked like today. Fixes
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/81 [reinout]

- Corrected my CSS/KSS bug in the story workflow state changer, re:
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/78 [simon]

- Added more of our content types to the kupu collections and
  linkables.  Fixes
  http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/72
  [maurits]

- Add an empty entry to the xm.add_task_form viewlet. Now one can
  quickly add tasks without having to assign anyone to it. [mark]


2.0 alpha 2 (2008-09-17)
------------------------

- Fixed UnicodeDecodeError in the state change viewlet.  [maurits]

- Cloned and tweaked the CSS for our clone of the Plone authoring
  actionMenu.  [simon]


2.0 alpha (2008-09-16)
----------------------

- Added 'locked status' logic so the release planning view can display it.
  Cleaned up release planning view logic, icluding class generation.
  Corrected relevant tests.

- Added CSS and exception-hardening to our previous work on reorderable
  stories - on failing to move a story we redirect to the story so it can be
  fixed. [reinout+simon]

- Made the eXtremeManagement PTSTranslationDomain available as
  zope.i18n domain.  This makes portal status messages from kss
  translatable again.  [maurits]

- Got the actual drag/drop to work. Needs more work though. [reinout]

- Started the view for reordering stories. [reinout+simon]

- Made the review state of tasks in the simple task list overview be
  a dropdown list with workflow transitioning via KSS, just like the
  default Plone review state.  [maurits+simon]

- @Lazy optimizations in browser/tasks.py. [reinout]

- Show link to xm time tracker in site actions when the xm.tracker
  package is available.  [maurits]

- Include zcml of xm.tracker when the package is there.  [maurits]

- Created @@xm_global_state view, with currently one method
  has_tracker which is True when the xm.tracker package is
  available.  [maurits]

- Treating booking's description as webintelligenttext. [reinout]

- Cleaned up redundancy in task_review template (issue #75).  [simon]

- Merged fix from the time tracker branch (issue #75): Changed
  task_overview template and tasks.py to display localised workflow
  state labels.  [simon]

- Merged fix from the time tracker branch: catch a divide by zero
  error.  [reinout]

- Merged the testing changes from the zest-timetracker branch.
  [maurits]

- Added Products.Poi to the install_requires in setup.py as Poi now
  has eggs for both branch 1.1 and trunk.  [maurits]

- made the print view for offer look nicer. Added new dutch translation.
  [mirella]

- Show attachments (Image, File, most importantly Story) in the
  project view, but only when xm.theme is not available, as that has
  a portlet and another view for this info.  (Merged from
  branches/1.6, r69421 and r69426.)

- Added tests for style conditions, which lead me to a bug in the logic. In
  the booking_month view, in case someone worked less than 40 hours in a week
  that total will be highligted. [jladage]

- Fix a Plone 3.0 support issue in the javascript registry.[jladage]

- fixed name typo in css [mirella]

- minor css changes to booking_month.pt, added translations and
  description for employees overview. Added odd color ad padding to
  employees overview, generated i18ndude and added the missing dutch
  translations and update_hours_form placed bookingsdate next to title.
  <th> has nowrap and left/right padding.[mirella]

- Now loading the zcml from kss.plugin.yuidnd automatically, so that
  package does not need to be included in [instance]zcml of buildout.cfg
  anymore. [maurits]


1.6.1 (2008-07-31)
------------------

2008-07-30 - mirella

  - removed hours/minutes from iteration view of start and enddate
    of an iteration.

2008-07-30 - jladage

  - bookings per month now doesn't highlight days with less than 8 hours.
    Instead it highlight if the hours per week is below 40 hours and if the
    billable percentage for a week is below 50%.

2008-07-23 - markvl

  - Made the check for customers in the myprojects view more
    robust. Employees which also have a customer role are no longer
    seen as customers.

2008-07-23 - mirella
  - added translations
  - show in iteration view the budget left in a row below the  total.
  - removed actual hours and budget left hours from the table above the stories.
  - fixed width of the table

2008-07-17 - mirella
  - changed width of storylist table in 97% for fixing IE7 problem of overlap.

2008-07-17 - jladage

  - Added migration for content types 'ProjectFolder' and 'CustomerFolder'
    back to regular folders.
  - Added a note about upgrading from older versions than 2.0.
  - Marked all code related to the following content types with BBB for easy
    cleanup in the next release.

1.6 final (2008-07-16)
----------------------

- Official Release, no changes since rc10


1.6 rc10 (2008-07-09)
---------------------

- Fixed name of permissions that had a rogue slash at the end.  Silly
  me.  [maurits]

- Fixed typos that referred to a different spelling of the
  Projectmanager role.  [maurits]


1.6 rc9 (2008-06-30)
--------------------

2008-06-26 - seletz

  - browser/xm_kss.py: Only update story viewlets in story context.
  - browser/viewlets/manager.py: delegate icon fetching to the view, and do it
    there such that it only returns the icon name.  That fixes the
    icon-of-iteration-is-not-found-if-site-is-named-plone bug.
  - browser/xm_kss.py: Only update viewlet for task bookings if we're actually
    in task context.  Otherwise we'll get a ComponentLookupError if the story
    gets activated (tasks get automatically transitioned from new->activated).


1.6 rc8 (2008-06-26)
--------------------

2008-06-26 - seletz

  - skins/eXtremeManagement/story_view.pt: Render the task list even
    if empty; otherwise the KSS-ified task adding cannot refresh the
    task list.
  - browser/xm_kss.py: fix comparsion of WF event states to fix a
    ComponentLookupError if adding tasks using KSS in a story.
  - added mr_savage and myself to the AUTHORS.txt (no CONTRIBUTORS.txt?)

2008-06-23 - reinout

  - 1.6 rc7 release

2008-06-16 - mr_savage

  - skins/task_overview.pt
    changed tal to use urlparameter memberid when constructing links
    to tasks in different states if param present in
    request

2008-06-16 - mr_savage

  - skins/booking_details.pt
    changed tal to use urlparameter memberid when constructing links
    to previous / current month if param present in
    request

2008-06-16 - mr_savage

  - skins/booking_year.pt
    changed tal to use urlparameter memberid when constructing links
    to previous / next year if param present in
    request

2008-06-16 - mr_savage

  - skins/booking_month.pt
    changed tal to use urlparameter memberid when constructing links
    to booking_year, previous-month, current-month if param present in
    request

2008-06-13 - mr_savage

  - browser/poi.py get_open_issues_in_project() now internally
      calls a multi adapter ( context, request ) to get issues
  - adapters.py
      default implementation of IXMIssueGetter
  - interfaces/xmissuegetter.py IXMIssueGetter interface
  - configure.zcml
       adapter registration

2008-06-10 - mr_savage

  - content/iteration.py set the default for the startDate to current
    DateTime

2008-06-06 - maurits

  - Split single kss event handler on the IAfterTransitionEvent into a
    story and task specific one.

  - Used xm.AddTask in a few spots.

  - Added permissions.zcml for defining permissions like xm.AddProject.

  - Register event handler to update some viewlets on the story page
    when that story gets a workflow transition.


2008-06-06 - maurits + jladage

  - Added getLayout method to Project.py.  This exists to please the
    discussion form.  Needed because we do not mix in the
    DynamicViewFTI class.  Note: this is also used by e.g. Stories by
    using acquisition.


2008-06-05 - maurits

  - Do not load the details for all stories in the project or
    iteration view.  Instead use KSS to show those details when
    wanted.  eXtreme.js is no longer needed, but can't be properly
    removed from the javascript registry with GenericSetup.

  - Fixed own mistake in generateUniqueId where this would fail if
    there were no tasks in the story yet.

2008-05-20 - maurits

  - Remove empty interfaces/IXMCustomer.py and accompanying Zope 3
    bridge.

  - Lots of pep8/pyflakes cleanup.

  - Remove the unused migration functions from setuphandlers.py.

2008-05-15 - maurits

  - In install.py do not notify the quick installer that we have
    installed our own GS profile; meanwhile there were three
    references to eXtremeManagement, Products.eXtremeManagement and
    profile-Products.eXtremeManagement in the quick installer in a
    test site.

  - Removed the upgrade profile for moving to 3.0 (that was removing a
    few actions from content types) as it was confusing for developers
    and now also for the quick installer.

2008-05-14 - maurits

  - Do not send task emails when updating the task schema, also when
    not using the (commented out) method in setuphandlers.py.

  - Fixed some bugs around bookings, mostly the detailed bookings view,
    including fixing some test failures.

2008-03-30 - jladage

  - Added 'billableProject' field to the Project content type. A booking
    will set the default value according to the projects value.

  - Extended the month_booking view with percentage of billable work, excluded
    double entries from previous months in total hours and greyed out those
    cells. If the employee booked less than 8 hours a day it's marked red.

2008-02-25 - jladage

  - Refactored the QuickInstaller code to use Install.py again to make sure
    our dependencies are installed correctly. Also move the GS profiles
    of xm.booking and xm.portlets to this profile.

2008-02-25 - mark

  - Change in the iteration workflow so the sharing tab is not shown
    for iterations and all content contained in them.

2008-02-14 - mark and maurits

  - Replaced the macros in the iteration and story views by providers.

2008-01-28 - mark

  - Make the add task KSS form more robust to also cope with a lack of
    assignees.

  - While we're at it: also add portal messages to provide feedback to
    the user when the task is added and when there is no title.

2008-01-21 - mark

  - The offer view has its own browser view class now.

  - In the offer view a story can be edited by a single click on the
    pencil icon. (That is, is the user has the "Modify portal content"
    permission on the stories.)

2008-01-20 - jladage

  - Up till now Customers had 'Delete object' and 'Copy and Move' permission
    with a project. Also the new Offer content type was addable by Customer.
    These security issues are now corrected. To update your site security,
    reinstall the product and hit the "Update security setting" in the
    portal_workflow.

20080-01-14 - mark

  - It is now also possible to directly assign someone to a task when
    using the form at the bottom of the story view.

  - Made several strings in page templates i18n aware.

2008-01-14 - jladage

  - Renamed non_iterations to attachment, because we filter our both
    iterations and offers. Minor changes to the project view, including
    translations

2008-01-11 - joris and mark

  - Additional content type: Offer.
    To bundle all the initial stories when a project starts.

2008-01-02 - maurits

  - Bugfix: no bookings were shown for January in the booking month
    overview.

  - Moved the graph option from the config.py to the xm_properties
    and optimistically renamed it project_chart in anticipation of
    more charts

  - Dynamically scale the labels for the y-axis so it shows human
    readable steps like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, ...

2007-12-12 - joris

  - Added charts to xm tool. Because this is the first release of charts
    they are disabled by default in the code. To enable the graphs, set
    GRAPHS to True in the config.py.

  - There is now one view with a chart: the Project view has a estimated
    hours and worked hours per iteration chart.

  - Added a form to the bottom of the story view (using a viewlet) to
    quickly add multiple tasks.

  - Added a budget field to the project content type and show the hours left
    on the iteration view (for open iterations).

  - Bugfix: DST bug in the week/month bookings overview and possibly
    some more.  It adds a good number of tests for that as well.

  - Added UI information to display the reason why a story or task cannot
    be "activated".

  - Task details table refactored to float to the right along with the
    new reason-task-cannot-be-activated details.

  - Replaced assignee username information being displayed on the task view
    with the "nicest" form of the user (ie full name if it exists, otherwise
    username).

  - Replaced booking "booked by" information being displayed on the task view
    with the "nicest" form of the user (ie full name if it exists, otherwise
    username).

  * Merge the mergeable parts of branches/1.2-events:

  - 38656:40204: small start with event handler, big cleanup of tests,
    add testbrowser tests, use IntDisplayList for Task/Booking
    hours/minutes.

  - 40226: only the part of this commit that changes doc/create.txt
    and tests dir: manually fire event.

  - 40256: use e.g. tasks.update(hours=5) instead of other ways to
    update fields, which helps in triggering a reindex.

  - 40417: add property sheet for eXtremeManagement with GenericSetup,
    containing HOURS_PER_DAY and MAXIMUM_NOT_COMPLETED_PERCENTAGE that
    used to be in AppConfig.py

  - 41415:41483: improve the order of the install function and the
    GenericSetup steps, moving functions from that quick installer to
    GS.  Add property send_task_mails to our property sheet, which can
    be set to False when updating the Task schema (which is done
    during install).

  - content/story.py
    getRawEstimate was accessing tasks by calling contentValues()
    we also want to allow other content apart from tasks in
    stories so i refactored the code in story
    to use the new method getStoryTasks that is aware of that.

  - skins/getStateSortedContent.py
    set the filter on Story and Task objects, to make a story
    containing other types than tasks beeing displayable.
    since the script is also used in a project to display stories
    i added  story as a type too.


2006-04-06 - friessnegger

  - tools/xmtool.py:
    added filtering capability to ``getFilteredIssues``

  - skins/xm_dashboard.pt
    refactored dashboard using a script rather than the tools-method
    to be able to call it anywhere in the portal and get all issues
    and tasks in the current path.
    dashboard only shows todo issues/tasks ('open', 'in-progress', ...)

2006-03-10 - batlogg, friessnegger
